  <h2 class='c008'>THE KYLOE OX.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>This most useful animal is a native
of Scotland, and is said to have derived
its name from having crossed
the kyles, or ferries, which abound
in the Highlands.</p>
<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i002.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='c013'>The Kyloe Ox is of a black
colour, and has a very thick hide, and
a great deal of hair. Its horns are
large and long. Its flesh is the finest
kind of beef: and there is scarcely a
single part of the Ox that cannot be
made use of. The hide is made into
leather, the gristles are made into
glue, the horns into knife-handles,
drinking-cups, &amp;c. and the bones
are a substitute for ivory.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>THE HORSE.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>This noble animal is found in almost
every part of the world. In Arabia
and Africa are wild horses, which
wander about in herds; and in South
America many thousands are seen
in one drove.</p>
<p class='c014'>The horse is used for riding, and
is then guided by the rein. He is
used for drawing carriages, carts,
and waggons, for ploughing, and
also for war. Hunting seems to be
enjoyed as much by the horse as by
his rider: and in the race he shows
great eagerness to be the foremost.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>THE HORSE.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c013'>When kindly used, the horse is
very fond both of his feeder and of
his rider. He has a very good memory.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>A gentleman once rode a
young horse thirty miles from his
home to see his friend. The horse
had never been in that part of the
country before, and the road was
hard to find: after asking the way of
many persons whom he met, the
gentleman at last got to his friend’s
house. Two years afterwards he
had again to go the same journey,
and it became quite dark, long before
he could get to the place. “Well,”
said he, “here I am, far from any
house, and I know not an inch of
the road, and I can hardly see my
horse’s head. I have heard much
of the memory of the horse; it is
my only hope now, go on;” so saying,
he threw the reins on his horse’s
neck, and in half an hour he was safe
at his friend’s gate.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>THE RACE HORSE.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>The horse is found in high perfection
in Arabia. To the people of that
country they are as dear as their
own children; and by constantly
living in the same tent with their
owner and his family, they become
very familiar and gentle. They are
not used to the spur, but the least
touch with the foot sets them in
motion. They form the principal
riches of many of the Arab tribes,
who use them both for plunder and
for the chase.</p>
<div  class='figcenter id002'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>THE RACE HORSE.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c013'>Of one of these people a touching
story is told. The whole stock of
a poor Arabian of the desert was a
mare, and he consented to sell her
to a French merchant for a very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>large sum of money. At length with
only a miserable rag to cover his
body he brought his noble courser
to the house of the buyer. Having
dismounted, he looked first at the
gold and then at the mare, and heaving
a deep sigh, he exclaimed, “To
whom is it that I am going to give
thee up? To Frenchmen, who will
tie thee close, who will beat thee,
who will render thee miserable!
Return with me my beauty! my
jewel! and rejoice the hearts of my
children!” Having said this he
sprang on her back, and was out of
sight in a moment. Still, for a continuance
of great exertion, the English
Race Horse is said to be
superior to the Arabian, and for fleetness,
he will yield to none. A Race
Horse will go at the rate of a mile in
less than two minutes.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>THE CART HORSE.</h2>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>THE CART HORSE.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c012'>Till of late years, Pack-Horses
were employed in the northern parts
of England, to carry goods and parcels.
In their journeys over barren
moors, they strictly observed the line
of order and regularity they were
first taught to keep. The leading
horse, always chosen for his steadiness
and sagacity, being furnished
with bells, gave notice to the rest,
which followed the sound, though
sometimes at a distance. Some years
ago, one of them who had been long
used to follow his leader, was from
accident or fatigue, put into an inferior
rank; when, as if sensible of
his disgrace, he by the greatest exertion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>recovered his usual station, but
on arriving at the inn-yard, he
dropped down dead!</p>
<p class='c014'>These horses are not now seen;
the old English Road Horse is strong
and active, and capable of enduring
great hardship; and though the form
of the common Cart Horse is heavy,
and his motion slow, he is extremely
useful, and is employed in a great
many ways. In London there have
been instances of a single horse
drawing, for a short space, so great
a weight as three tons.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>THE MULE.</h2>
</div>
<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i021.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>THE MULE.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c012'>The common Mule sometimes lives
to the age of thirty years. It is very
useful in carrying burdens, particularly
in very mountainous places,
where horses are not so sure-footed.
People of the first quality in Spain
are drawn by Mules. Their going
down the mountains of the Alps is
very wonderful. They place their
fore feet as if they were stopping
themselves; they then put their
hinder feet together, but a little forward,
as if they were about to lie
down. In this way, having taken a
look over the road, they slide down
with great swiftness. In the mean
time, all the rider has to do is, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>keep himself fast on the saddle without
checking the rein; for the least
motion is sufficient to disorder the
equal balance of the animal, in which
case both would certainly be dashed
to pieces. In their swiftest motion,
when they seem to have lost all government
of themselves, they follow
exactly the different windings of the
road, as if they had settled in their
minds which way they were to go.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>THE ASS.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>The Ass has to endure the hardest
labour, and is contented with the
coarsest food. The statement that
Asses are stubborn animals is not

<p>THE ASS.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c013'>An old man, who a few years ago
sold vegetables in London, used in
his employment an Ass, which conveyed
his baskets from door to door.
He frequently gave the poor creature
a handful of hay, or a piece of coarse
bread, or some greens, by way of refreshment
and reward. The old man
had no need of any stick for the animal,
indeed he seldom had to lift up
his hand to drive it on. This kind
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>treatment being one day observed,
he was asked whether his beast was
not apt to be stubborn. “Ah! master
(he replied), it is of no use to be cruel;
and as for stubbornness I cannot
complain, for he is ready to do any
thing, and to go any where. I bred
him myself. He is sometimes skittish
and playful, and once ran away
from me; there were then more
than fifty people after him, attempting
in vain to stop him, yet after all
he turned back of his own accord,
and never stopped till he ran his head
kindly into my bosom.”</p>

<p>THE BULL.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c013'>Bull-baiting is a very cruel sport;
this mode of killing Bulls is derived
from one kind of ancient hunting,
very like the Spanish bull-fights of
the present day. On notice being
given that a wild Bull would be slain
on a certain day, the inhabitants of
the neighbourhood assembled, sometimes
to the number of a hundred
horsemen, and four or five hundred
foot, all armed with guns or other
weapons. Those on foot stood upon
the walls or got into trees, while the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>horsemen rode off a Bull from the rest
of the herd, until he stood at bay,
when they dismounted and fired. At
some of these huntings twenty or
thirty shots have been fired before the
animal was killed. This dangerous
sport is now but little practised.
There is scarcely any part of the Ox
that is not of some use to mankind.
Boxes, combs, knife-handles, and
drinking vessels, are made of the
horns. Glue is made of the sinews,
gristles, and the finer pieces of cuttings
and parings of the hides, boiled
in water till they become jelly-like,
and the parts sufficiently dissolved,
and then dried. The bone is a cheap
substitute, in many instances, for
ivory. And the thinnest of the
calves-skins are made into vellum.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>THE COW.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c012'>The Cow is the most important
animal of the farmer’s stock. Being
equally capable of enduring heat and
cold. It is an inhabitant of the frozen,
as well as of the most scorching climates.
There are a great variety
of kinds; and they are all of a very
humble and gentle disposition. The
climate and pastures of Great Britain
are well adapted to the nature
of this animal; and we are indebted
to the variety and abundance of our
wholesome vegetables, for the number
and excellence of our cattle,
which range over our hills, and enliven
our plains—a source of wealth
and boast to this happy country.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>Not having the upper fore-teeth, the
Cow prefers the high and rich grass
in pastures, to the short and more
delicate herbage generally selected
by the horse. For this reason, where
the grass is rather high and flourishing
in our pastures than large
and full, the Cow thrives well;
and there is no part of Europe in
which this animal grows larger,
gives more milk, or fattens sooner.
The quantity of milk given by Cows
is various; some give only about six
quarts in a day, whilst others give
from fifteen to twenty.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>THE RAM.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c012'>Sheep are very useful animals: they
are quiet and harmless. They tremble
at the voice of the shepherd, or
at the barking of his dog; but, on
the great hills where they run about
at liberty, away from the shepherd,
they shew more courage. Sometimes
a Ram or Wether will boldly attack
a single dog, and often come off victorious;
but when the danger is more
alarming, they collect the strength
of the whole flock. On such occasions
they draw up in a complete body,
placing the female and the young in
the middle, while the males take the
foremost ranks, keeping close by
each other. Thus an armed front is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>formed on all sides that cannot easily
be attacked without danger of destruction
to the dog. In this manner
they wait with firmness the approach
of the enemy, nor does their courage
fail them in the moment of attack:
for, when the dog advances within a
few yards of the line, the Rams dart
upon him with such force as to lay
him dead at their feet, unless he save
himself in time by flight.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>THE SHEEP.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c012'>Sheep supply us both with food and
clothing: and the wool alone affords,
in some countries, an amazing source
of industry and wealth. They are
harmless animals, and, in general,
very shy and timid. The Sheep in
the high mountains of Wales are
very wild, and do not collect into
large flocks, but graze in parties
of from eight to a dozen. One is
always placed at a distance from the
rest, to give notice of the approach
of danger. When he observes a
stranger advancing, he allows him
to approach as near, perhaps, as
eighty or a hundred yards, but keeps
a watchful eye upon his motions; if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>the stranger shows a design of
coming closer, he alarms the rest of
the flock by a loud hiss or whistle,
twice or thrice repeated, when the
whole party instantly scour away
with great speed, to the most inaccessible
parts of the mountains. No
country produces finer Sheep than
Great Britain. Of these the Sheep
that are bred in Lincolnshire and the
northern parts, are the largest and
bear the most wool. In other parts
of England they are generally
smaller; and in the mountainous
parts of Wales and Scotland they
are very small.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>THE GOAT.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c012'>Although very shy and timid in a
wild state, goats are easily trained
as domestic animals, being very sensible
of kind treatment. The disposition
of this creature is, however,
extremely unsettled, as is shewn by
the irregularity of all his actions.
He walks, stops short, runs, leaps,
approaches or retires, shews and
conceals himself, or flies off, as if induced
by mere whim, and without
any other cause than what arises
from the strange vivacity of his temper.
Goats love to feed on the tops
of hills, and prefer the very elevated
and rugged parts of mountains, finding
sufficient food in the most heathy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>and barren grounds. They are so
active as to leap with ease and the
utmost security, among the most
dreadful precipices; and even when
two of them are yoked together,
they will, as it were by mutual consent,
take the most hazardous leaps
together, and exert their efforts in
such a united manner as generally
to get through the danger unhurt.
In mountainous countries they are
of great service to mankind; the flesh
of the old ones being salted as winter
provision, and the milk being used
in many places for making cheese.
These animals require but little care
and attention, and easily provide for
themselves proper and sufficient
food.</p>

of the Deer kind. The elegance of
his form, the lightness of his motions,
the flexibility of his limbs, his bold
branching horns, which are yearly
renewed, his grandeur, strength and
swiftness, give him a decided rank
over every other inhabitant of the
forest. The age of the Stag is known
by its horns: he begins to shed them
about the end of February or the
beginning of March: each year they
become larger.</p>

</div>
<p class='c013'>The usual colour of the Stag, in
England, is red; in other countries
it is commonly brown or yellow.
His eye is extremely beautiful, soft
and sparkling: his hearing is quick;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>and his sense of smell very strong.
When listening, he raises his head,
erects his ears, and seems attentive
to every noise, which he can hear at
a great distance. When he approaches
a thicket, he stops to look
round him on all sides; if he perceives
nothing to alarm him, he moves
slowly forward; but on the least appearance
of danger, he flies off with
the rapidity of the wind. He appears
to listen with great delight to the
sound of the shepherd’s pipe, which
is sometimes made use of to ensnare
him to his destruction.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>THE FALLOW DEER.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>These animals live together in
herds, which sometimes divide into
two parties, and maintain obstinate
battles for the possession of a favourite
part of the park: each one
having its leader, which is always
the oldest and strongest of the flock.
They attack in regular order of battle;
they fight with courage, and
mutually defend each other.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>THE FALLOW DEER.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c013'>The chief difference between the
Stag and the Fallow deer, seems to
be in the size and form of their horns;
the latter are much smaller than
those of the former. The Fallow deer
is easily tamed, feeds on a variety
of things which the stag refuses,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>and preserves its condition nearly
the same throughout the year, although
its flesh, called venison, is
considered much finer at particular
seasons. We have in England two
varieties of the Fallow deer, which
are said to be of foreign origin: the
beautiful spotted kind were brought
from Bengal in India. These animals,
with some variation, are found in
almost every country of Europe.
Those of Spain are as large as stags,
but darker; their necks are also
more slender; and their tails, which
are longer than those of ours, are
black above, and white beneath.</p>

<p class='c012'>The form of the Roebuck is elegant,
and its motions light and easy. It
bounds seemingly without much
effort, and runs with great swiftness.
When hunted, it tries to evade its
pursuers by the most curious methods:
it often returns upon its former
steps, till, by various windings,
it entirely misleads the hounds. This
cunning animal then, by a sudden
spring, bounds to one side; and,
lying close down upon its belly, lets
the hounds pass by, without offering
to stir.</p>

in many parts of England and
Wales; but at present it is to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>found only in the Highlands of Scotland.
It is the smallest of all the
Deer kind, being only three feet four
inches long, and rather more than
two feet in height: the horns are
from eight to nine inches long, upright,
round, and divided into three
branches; the body is covered with
long hair. When the female has
young, and they are in danger, she
hides them in a thicket; and, to
preserve them, offers herself to be
chased. Numbers of fawns are taken
alive from their dams by the peasants,
and many are worried by
dogs, foxes, and other enemies; so
that the beautiful Roe is becoming
daily more scarce.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Boar is naturally stupid, inactive,
and drowsy. It is very restless
at a change of the weather: and
during high winds it runs about with
great violence, screaming loudly at
the same time. It is thought to
foresee the approach of bad weather.
Before a storm comes on it may be
seen carrying straw to its sty, for
the purpose of making itself a bed.</p>

fond. It has likewise a quick sense of
smelling.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>The flesh of the Hog is of great

<p>THE SOW.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c012'>The Sow is, generally speaking, a
harmless and inoffensive creature.
Its food consists of a variety of things
that would otherwise be wasted; the
refuse of the field, the garden, the
barn, or the kitchen, afford them a
very good meal. These animals select
with great sagacity and niceness
the plants they prefer, and are never
poisoned like some others by mistaking
one plant for another. Selfish,
obstinate, and greedy as many think
them, no animal, it is said, has greater
feeling for those of its own kind.
They have been known to gather
round a dog that teased them, and kill
him on the spot. If a male and female
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>are put in a sty together when young,
the female will not eat her food for
some time if her companion is removed
from her.</p>
<p class='c014'>Many things shew that they are
not quite so stupid as some are inclined
to believe. We have had exhibitions
of their ingenuity, which
have attracted great attention and
astonishment. And it is stated as a
remarkable fact, that a gamekeeper
actually broke in a New Forest Sow
to find game nearly as well as a

</div>
<p class='c012'>The Tame Cat may be found in almost
all countries, and it differs but
little from the wild cat except in the
brightness of its colours. It is very
useful in our houses in catching the
rats and mice.</p>

<p>THE TAME CAT.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c013'>Of all animals when young, there
is none more prettily playful and
amusing than the Kitten, and little
children are mostly very fond of
them; but it generally changes its
disposition as it grows older. From
being naturally ravenous, it learns
in time to disguise its appetite, and
to seize the favourable moment for
plunder. Sly and artful, it has
learned to conceal its intentions till
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>it can put them in force: and whenever
the opportunity occurs, it directly
seizes upon whatever it finds,
flies off with it, and remains at a distance
till it thinks its offence is forgotten.
Instances of the fidelity of
Cats, however, are not so rare as
some would have us imagine. A
French traveller had an Angora Cat,
a native of Egypt, which kept by his
side in his solitary moments; she
often interrupted him in his meditations
by affectionate caresses, and
in his absence sought and called for
him with great inquietude.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>THE WILD CAT.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c012'>The hair of the Wild Cat is soft and
fine, and of a pale yellow colour,
mixed with grey; a dusky-coloured
line runs along the back, from its
head to its tail; the tail is thick, and
marked with bars of black and white.
It is larger and stronger than the
tame Cat, and its fur much longer.
It inhabits the most hilly and woody
parts of this island, lives in trees, and
hunts for birds and small animals,
such as rabbits, hares, rats, mice,
moles, &amp;c.; and it is also very destructive
among poultry. The Cat
seems to possess something like an
additional sense, by means of its
whiskers. These whiskers consist
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>not only of long hairs on the upper
lips, but also of four or five others
standing up from each eyebrow,
and also two or three on each cheek;
all of which, when the animal erects
them, make, with their extremities,
so many points in the compass of a
circle as to be at least equal in extent
to their own bodies. With this
assistance, it is supposed it can at
once discover whether any hole or
space is large enough to admit the
body, which to those living in a wild
state is of the greatest consequence;
and to the domestic Cat of great service.</p>

two inches and a half. The most
usual colour of the Weasel is a pale
reddish brown on the back, sides,
and legs; the throat and belly are
white. This animal is very common,
and well known in this country; it
is destructive to young birds, poultry,
and rabbits, and is a keen devourer
of eggs. It will follow a young hare,
which becomes so terrified as to
give itself up to it without resistance,
making at the same time the most
piteous outcries.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>THE WEASEL.</p>

farmer. During the winter it frequents
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>his barns and granaries,
which it clears of rats and mice; it
is a more deadly enemy to them than
even the Cat; for being more active
and slender it pursues them into
their holes, and kills them quickly.
Though the Weasel is a wild little
animal, there are instances to prove,
that it is capable of being made quite
tame. They have been taught to
lick the hand from which they
receive their food, and even to follow

<div class='ic002'>
<p>THE MARTIN.</p>

</div>
<p class='c012'>The Martin lives chiefly in the pine-tree
forests of North America. The
principal difference between the
Pine-Weasel and the Martin is in
the colour. The breast of the former
is yellow; the colour of the body
much darker; and the fur in general,
greatly superior in fineness,
beauty, and value. The Martin is
about eighteen inches long; the tail
is ten inches long, and full of hair,
especially towards the end, which is
thick and bushy; the ears are broad,
round and open; the body is covered
with a thick fur, of a dark brown
colour: the head is brown, mixed
with red; the throat and breast are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>white; the feet are broad, and
covered on the under side with a thick
fur; the claws are white, large, and
sharp, well adapted for climbing
trees, where it mostly lives. The
skin has a very nice scent; its fur
is valuable, and highly prized. When
taken young, it is easily tamed, and
becomes very playful and good-humoured,
but is not to be depended
upon. It readily takes advantage of
the first opportunity to regain its liberty,
and retire to the woods. The
food of the Martin consists of rats,
mice, poultry, game, birds, and
grain, and it is also extremely fond
of honey.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>THE FERRET.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c012'>This little creature is a native of
Africa, and is only known to us in a
domestic state. It is unable to bear
a cold climate, and cannot live without
great care and shelter. It is
usually kept in a box, with wool, of
which it makes itself a warm bed.
It sleeps a great part of the day;
and the moment it awakes, it seems
eager for its food, which is commonly
bread and milk. The length of the
Ferret is about fourteen inches; the
tail is five inches long; its nose is
sharper than that of the Weasel, its
ears are round, and its eyes red and
fiery: the colour of the whole body
is a very pale yellow. When employed
to clear the rabbit warren,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>it must be muzzled, that it may not
kill the rabbits in their holes, but
only oblige them to come out, that
the warrener may catch them in his
nets. If the Ferret be suffered to
go in without a muzzle, or should
free himself from it whilst in the
hole, there is great danger of losing
it: for, after satisfying itself with
blood, it falls asleep, and it is then
almost impossible to get at it. The
most usual method is by digging it
out, or smoking the hole. If these

<p>THE POLECAT.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c012'>The Polecat is not afraid of mankind,
but approaches our dwellings
with confidence, mounts to their
roofs, and often lives in barns, hay-lofts,
or other places that are much
frequented. From thence he prowls
about under the shadow of night, to
attack the poultry. He is very active,
and runs fast. While running, his
belly seems to touch the ground; but
in preparing to jump, he arches his
back very much, by means of which
the force of his spring is greatly increased.
The Polecat, during summer,
lives in woods, or about rabbit-warrens.
Here, if he cannot find a
hole ready made that suits him, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>forms a retreat for himself, in the
ground, about two yards in length,
which he contrives, if he can, to end
among the roots of some large tree.
From thence he often comes forth
and destroys game and rabbits.
These animals are also very fond of
honey; and in winter when the bees
are weakened by the coldness of the
season, they have been known to attack
the hives and to devour their
contents very eagerly.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>THE BADGER.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c012'>This animal is a native of Europe,
but is known to live in warm countries.
It is found, without any variety,
in Spain, France, Italy, Germany,
Britain, Poland, and Sweden. The
usual length of the Badger is somewhat
above two feet, and the tail is
about six inches long; its eyes are
small, and are placed in a black stripe
which begins behind the ears, and
runs towards the nose; the throat
and legs are black; the back, sides,
and tail, are of a dirty grey, mixed
with black; the legs and feet are
very short, strong, and thick; each
foot has five toes; those on the fore
feet are armed with strong claws,
well adapted for digging.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>Although furnished with powerful
weapons of offence, and having besides
strength to use them with great
effect, it is very harmless and inoffensive;
and unless attacked, employs
them only for its support. The Badger
retires to the most secret places,
where it digs its hole, and forms its
dwelling under ground. Its food
consists chiefly of roots, fruits, grass,
insects, and frogs. Few creatures
defend themselves better, or bite
with greater keenness, than the
Badger. On that account it has been
often baited with dogs trained for
the purpose; but, happily, little is
now heard of this very cruel sport.
The Badger is a very sleepy animal.
It keeps its hole during the day, and
feeds only in the night.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>THE FOX.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c012'>The Fox is a native of almost every
quarter of the globe; and is of so
wild and savage a nature that it is
said to be impossible fully to tame
him: when partially so, he is very
playful; but will on the least offence,
bite those with whom he is most familiar.
He possesses more cunning
than any other beast of prey. This
quality he shows in his mode of providing
for himself a place of security,
where he retires from pressing dangers,
and brings up his young; and
his craftiness is also discovered by
his schemes to catch lambs, geese,
hens, and all kinds of small birds.</p>
<p class='c014'>When he can conveniently do so,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>the Fox fixes his abode on the border
of a wood, in the neighbourhood
of some farm or village. He listens
to the crowing of the cocks, or the
cries of the poultry. He scents them
at a distance; he chooses his time
with judgment; and conceals his
road, as well as his design. He slips
forward with caution, sometimes
even trailing his body; and seldom
misses his booty. If he can leap the
wall, or creep in beneath the gate,
he ravages the court-yard, puts all
to death, and retires with his prey.
He hunts the young hares in the
plains; and seizes the old ones in
their seats. The eye of the Fox is
of a lively hazel colour, and very
expressive.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>THE WOLF.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>These animals are natives of almost
all the temperate and cold countries
of the globe; and were formerly so
numerous in this island, that King
Edgar, about a thousand years ago,
changed the punishments for some
offences, into a demand of a certain
number of Wolves’ tongues from
each criminal; and once converted
a heavy and oppressive tax on one
of the Welsh princes, into a yearly
tribute of three hundred Wolves’
heads. Some hundred years after,
these animals increased to such a
degree, that great rewards were
given for destroying them.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>THE WOLF.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c013'>The Wolf is very savage indeed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>when it is hungry. It then braves
every danger, and even attacks
those animals that are protected by
man. Man himself, upon these occasions,
frequently falls a victim to
its power; and it is said, that when
Wolves have once tasted human
blood, they always give it the preference.
The Wolf has great strength,
especially in the muscles of his neck
and jaw: he can carry a sheep in his
mouth, and easily run off with it in
that manner. His bite is cruel and
deadly, and keener as it meets with
no opposition: but when opposed,
he is cautious and careful, and seldom
fights but from necessity. Sometimes
whole droves of them join in
the cruel work of destruction.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>THE SHEPHERD’S DOG.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c012'>This useful animal, ever faithful to
his charge, reigns at the head of the
flock, where he is better heard, and
more attended to, than even the
Shepherd himself. In the few remaining
large tracts of land which
are appropriated to the feeding of
Sheep, this dog is of the utmost importance.
Large flocks range over
extensive tracts of land, seemingly
without controul: their only guide
being the Shepherd, attended by his
Dog, the constant companion of his
toil. It receives his commands, and
is always prompt to execute them;
it is the watchful guardian of the
flock, prevents straying, keeps them
together, and conducts them from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>one pasture to another: it will not
suffer strange sheep to mix with
them, but carefully keeps off every
intruder. In driving a number of
sheep to any distant part, a well-trained
Dog never fails to confine
them to the road; he watches every
avenue that leads from it, where he
takes his stand, to prevent them
from going out of the way. He
pursues the stragglers if any escape,
and forces them into order, without
doing them the least injury. If the
Shepherd be at any time absent he
depends upon his Dog to keep them
together; and as soon as he gives the
well-known signal, this faithful creature
conducts them to his master,
though at a great distance.</p>

<p>THE BULLDOG.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c012'>When little children meet any dogs
they should take care not to tease
them, more particularly the Bulldog,
for when that dog is completely
roused it is the fiercest of its kind,
and is probably the most courageous
creature in the world. It is low in
stature, but very strong. Its nose
is short; and the under jaw projects
beyond the upper, which makes it
look very fierce. Its courage in attacking
the bull is well known; its
fury in seizing and its obstinacy in
keeping its hold, are truly astonishing.
It always aims at the front,
and generally fastens upon the lip,
the tongue, the eye, or some part of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>the face; where it hangs in spite of
every effort of the bull to get away
from it.</p>
<p class='c014'>Many stories are told us of this
most cruel sport; but of late years
the inhuman custom of baiting the
bull has been almost entirely laid
aside, and there are now few Dogs
of this kind to be seen. The great
danger of the Bulldog is, he always
makes his attack without barking.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>THE NEWFOUNDLAND DOG.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>This breed of Dogs was originally
brought from the country of which
they bear the name, where their
great strength and sagacity render
them extremely useful to the settlers
on those coasts, who use them in
bringing down wood from the forests
to the sea side. Three or four of
them yoked to a sledge, will draw
two or three hundred weight of wood
piled upon it, for several miles, with
great ease: they are not attended by
a driver, nor any person to guide
them; but after having delivered
their loading, they return immediately
to the woods, where they are
accustomed to be fed.</p>

<p class='c013'>During a severe storm in the winter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>of 1789, a ship, belonging to
Newcastle, was lost near Yarmouth;
and a Newfoundland Dog alone
escaped to the shore, bringing in his
mouth the captain’s pocket-book.
He landed amidst a number of people,
several of whom tried in vain to
take it from him. The sagacious
animal, as if sensible of the importance
of the charge which in all probability
was delivered to him by his
perishing master, at length leapt
fawningly against the breast of a
man, who had attracted his notice
among the crowd, and delivered
the book to him. The Dog immediately
returned to the place where he
had landed, and watched with great
attention every thing that came from
the wrecked vessel, and tried to bring
it to shore.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>THE GREYHOUND.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c012'>The Greyhound is the fleetest of all
dogs, and can outrun every animal
of the chase; but as it wants the faculty
of scenting, it follows only by
the eye. It was formerly held in
such estimation, as to be considered
the peculiar companion of gentlemen;
and by the forest laws of King Canute,
about a thousand years ago, it
was enacted, that no person under
that degree should presume to keep
a Greyhound. It was supposed to
be the Irish Greyhound, rendered
thinner and more delicate by the
difference of climate and of culture.
The Irish Greyhound is the largest
of the dog kind, and its appearance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>the most beautiful and majestic. It
is only to be found in Ireland, where
it was formerly of great use in clearing
the country of wolves. It is now
extremely rare, and is kept more for
show than for use, being equally unserviceable
for hunting the stag, the
fox, or the hare. These dogs are
about three feet high, generally of a
white or cinnamon colour, and in
make resemble a Greyhound. Their
aspect is mild, their disposition gentle
and peaceable, and their strength so
great, that in combat the mastiff or
bulldog is far from being equal to
them. They commonly seize their
antagonists by the back, and shake
them to death, which their great size
generally enables them to do with
ease.</p>

<p>THE FOXHOUND.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c012'>The Foxhounds generally preferred
are tall, light-made, but strong, and
possessed of great courage, speed,
and activity. No country in Europe
can boast of Dogs of this kind, of
equal swiftness, strength, or agility,
to those of Great Britain, where the
utmost attention is paid to their
training. The climate also seems
congenial to their nature; for it has
been said that when Hounds of English
breed have been sent into
France, or other countries, they in
some degree lose those admirable
qualities for which they were once
so remarkable. In England attachment
to the chase has been considered
a trait in the national character; from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>the care and attention which have
been given to the rearing of Dogs
and Horses, it is no matter of surprise
that this country should excel
all others in that diversion.</p>
<p class='c014'>Many years since a very large
stag was turned out of Wingfield
Park, in the county of Westmorland,
and was pursued by the Hounds, till,
by fatigue or accident the whole pack
was thrown out, except two favourite
Dogs which continued the chase the
greater part of the day. The stag
returned to the park from whence he
set out; and, as his last effort, leapt
the wall, and immediately expired.
One of the Hounds pursued him
thither; but, being unable to get
over, laid down and died: the other
dog was found dead at a little distance.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>THE HARRIER.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c012'>These Dogs are kept for the business
of the chase. They pursue the
hare with the greatest eagerness,
hardly giving her time to breathe.
The most eager sportsmen find it
sufficient exercise to keep in with
their speed. There is a kind of Dog
between this and the large Terrier,
which forms a strong, active, and
hardy Hound, used in hunting the
otter. It is rough, wire-haired,
thick-quartered, long-eared, and thin-shouldered.
There is reason to suppose,
that the Beagle and the Harrier
must have been introduced into
Great Britain after the Romans became
masters of the island a thousand
years ago, as, before that time the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>Britons were occupied in clearing
their extensive forests of the various
wild beasts, such as wild boars, bears
and wolves, with which they then
abounded; and for that purpose
larger and stronger dogs than the
Harrier or the Beagle would be required.</p>
<p class='c014'>In the New Forest, in 1810, a person,
in getting over a stile observed
there was blood upon it; he knew
that deer had been killed, and sheep
stolen. He obtained a bloodhound.
The dog being brought to the spot
and led to the scent followed in it, and
at length came to a heap of furze,
belonging to a cottager. The woman
of the house attempted to drive away
the dog, but was prevented. On removing
the faggots a hole was found
containing the body of a sheep and
a quantity of salted meat.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>THE POINTER.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c012'>This dog is highly esteemed for its
use in the pursuit of game. It is remarkable
for the quickness with
which it receives instruction. It may
be said to be almost self-taught;
whilst the old English dog requires
the greatest care and attention in
breaking and training to the sport.
The Spanish Pointer, however, is
not so durable and hardy, nor so
able to undergo the fatigues of an
extensive sport. It is chiefly employed
in finding partridges, and
pheasants, either for the gun or the
net. It is said that an English nobleman,
Robert Dudley, Duke of
Northumberland, in the days of King
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>Edward VI. was the first who broke
a setting-dog to the net. We are
often astonished at the senses of the
higher quadrupeds, such as the dog
and the horse, by which man employs
them for his use. The senses most
called into action in the dog are those
of smell and hearing. Accordingly
the fox-hound can tell the scent of
the fox he is pursuing from one that
may cross his path; the spaniel or
terrier will track his master by his
scent through a crowded city; the
watch-dog barks when no one else
hears a foot fall. This is partly natural
and partly attained by exercise
and attention.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>THE SPANIEL.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c012'>This kind of dog is of great value,
from the readiness with which it receives
instruction, the quickness
with which it obeys commands, and
its great docility and strong attachment
to its master. Of this one
striking proof may be given. Old
Daniel, the gamekeeper to the Rev.
Mr. Corsellis, had reared a Spaniel
named Dash, which became his constant
attendant both by night and
day. Wherever the gamekeeper appeared,
Dash was never far distant.
When the gamekeeper died, little
Dash would not quit the body, but
laid upon the bed by its side. After
his master was buried, this faithful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>dog would frequently visit the room
where he breathed his last, and would
remain there for hours. From thence,
for fourteen days he constantly visited
the grave, at the end of which
time he died.</p>
<p class='c014'>Perhaps the most remarkable instance
of attachment is that of the
little dog who crept within the clothes
of Mary Queen of Scots just previous
to her execution, and could not afterward
be separated from the corpse
but by force.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>THE TERRIER.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>The Terrier is a very hardy dog,
and is of much service to us, as he is
an exceeding great enemy to rats
and most other vermin: he has very
great courage, and will even attack
the badger, nor does he seem to care
for the desperate wounds he often receives
when fighting with it. He is
more particularly useful, on account
of having such a very acute scent.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>THE TERRIER.</p>

</div>
<p class='c013'>There are two varieties of this dog,
the one has got very short legs, a
long back, and is commonly of a black
or yellowish colour mingled with
white; the other is of a more sprightly
appearance, with a much shorter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>body, and the colour of this species is
a reddish-brown or black.</p>

<p class='c014'>When gentlemen go out a hunting,
they generally take one of these dogs
to accompany their hounds, for they
are very expert in forcing foxes and
other game from their coverts; and
their scent being so very quick, they
often cause a great deal of amusement.</p>

</div>
<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i141.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='c012'>This animal not possessing any
means of self defence is furnished by
Providence with a high degree of
fear. It is attentive to every alarm,
and is furnished with very long ears,
which are tube-like, and catch the
most remote sounds. The eyes are
so prominent, as to enable the animal
to see both before and behind.
The Hare feeds in the evening, and
sleeps during the day, and, as he
mostly lies on the ground, he has the
feet protected, both above and below,
with a thick covering of hair. In a
moonlight evening many of these
creatures may sometimes be seen
starting together, leaping about and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>pursuing each other; but the least
noise alarms them, and they then
scamper off each in a different direction.
Their pace is a kind of gallop,
or quick succession of leaps; and
they are very swift, particularly in
ascending hills. In winter they generally
choose a form exposed to the
south, and in summer they change
this for one looking to the north: in
both cases, they have the instinct of
commonly fixing on a place where
the objects around them are nearly
of the colour of their bodies.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>THE RABBIT.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c012'>The Rabbit abounds in Great
Britain, where its skin forms a very
considerable article in the manufactory
of hats. Although the Hare
and the Rabbit are so like each other,
nature has placed a strong barrier
between them, in their feeling of
mutual aversion. Besides this, there
is a wide difference in their habits
and pursuits: the rabbit lives in holes
in the earth, where it brings forth its
young, and retires from the approach
of danger; whilst the Hare prefers
the open fields, and trusts to its
speed for safety. The female makes
a bed of down for her young, which
she pulls off her own coat. She never
leaves them, but when pressed with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>hunger, and returns as soon as that
is supplied. During the time she
tends them, she carefully conceals
them from the male, lest he should
devour them; and often covers up the
mouth of the hole, that her retreat
may not be discovered. The tame
Rabbit is of various colours, and is
somewhat larger than the wild
Rabbit; but its flesh is not so good,
being softer and more insipid. Its
food is generally cabbage leaves,
colewort, blades of corn, sourdock,
and other moist plants; but sweet
short hay, and a little clean oats,
make the best diet.</p>

<p>THE SQUIRREL.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c012'>This beautiful little creature is of a
bright brown colour, inclined to red;
the breast and belly are white; the
ears are ornamented with long tufts
of hair; the eyes are large, black,
and lively; the fore teeth strong and
sharp; and the fore legs are curiously
furnished with long stiff hairs, which
project on each side like whiskers.
When it eats, it sits upright, and
uses its fore feet as hands to convey
food to its mouth. It is equally
admired for its neatness and elegance
of form, as for its liveliness and activity.
Its disposition is gentle and
harmless. Though naturally wild,
and very timid, it is easily taught to
receive with freedom the most familiar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>caresses from the hand that
feeds it. It usually lives in woods,
and makes its nest of moss or dry
leaves in the hollow of trees. It
seldom descends upon the ground,
but leaps from tree to tree with great
agility. Its food consists of fruits,
almonds, nuts, and acorns; of which
it collects great stores for winter provision,
and secures them carefully
near its nest. In the summer it feeds
on buds and young shoots, and is
very fond of the cones or apples of
the fur and pine trees. The tail of
the Squirrel is its greatest ornament,
and serves as a defence from the cold,
being large enough to cover the
whole body; it likewise assists it in
leaping from one tree to another.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>THE DORMOUSE.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>This animal is very much like the
common mouse. Its colour is a
tawny red, the throat white, the tail
tufted. When it is thirsty it does
not lap, but dips its fore feet, with
the toes bent, into the water, and
drinks from them. In the summer
this curious little creature is very
industrious, laying up its provision
for the winter, which consists of
nuts, beans, and acorns. As soon
as the cold weather approaches, it
rolls itself up into a ball, with its
tail curled over its head between its
ears, and continues in that state till
the warm weather comes again.</p>

<p>THE DORMOUSE.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c013'>Dormice build their nests either
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>in the hollows of trees, or near the
bottom of thick shrubs, and line them
with moss, soft birchens, and dried
leaves. Conscious of the length of
time they have to pass in their solitary
cells, they are very choice of the
materials they make use of.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>THE RAT.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c012'>There are two kinds known in this
country—the Black Rat, which was
formerly universal, but is now very
rarely seen, having been almost all
destroyed by the large brown kind,
generally distinguished by the name
of the Norway Rat. This formidable
invader is now found throughout the
country, from whence every method
has been tried in vain to expel it.
It is about nine inches long; of a
light brown colour, the throat and
under part of a dirty white inclining
to grey; its feet are naked, and of a
pale flesh colour; and the tail is as
long as the body. It is a very bold
little animal, and when closely pursued,
will turn and fasten on its assailant.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>Its bite is keen, and the
wound it inflicts is painful, and difficult
to heal, owing to the form of its
teeth, which are long, sharp, and
irregular. It is a very singular
fact in the history of these animals,
that the skins of such as have been devoured
in their holes, (and they frequently
feed upon each other,) have
been found curiously turned inside
out; every part being completely
turned, even to the ends of the toes.
How the operation is performed, it
would be difficult to discover; but it
appears to be effected by some peculiar
mode of eating out the contents.
Besides the numbers that perish in
this unnatural way, they have many
fierce and terrible enemies that take
every opportunity to destroy them.</p>

</div>
<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i161.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>THE WATER RAT.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c012'>The Water Rat is somewhat smaller
than the common brown Rat; its
head and nose are thicker; its eyes
are small; its ears short, scarcely
appearing through the hair; its teeth
are large, strong and yellow. In an
old one, the lower front teeth measure
somewhat more than half an
inch in length. The hair on its head
and body is thicker and longer than
that of the common Rat, and chiefly
of a dark brown colour, mixed with
red; the belly is grey; the tail five
inches long, covered with short
black hairs, and the tip of the tail is
white. The Water Rat generally
frequents the sides of rivers, ponds,
and ditches, where it burrows, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>forms its nest. It feeds on frogs,
small fish, and spawn; swims and
dives remarkably fast; and can continue
a long time under water.</p>
<p class='c014'>The Musk Rat somewhat resembles
the one just described. The
eyes are large; the ears short,
rounded, and covered both inside
and outside with hair. Its fur is soft,
glossy, and of a reddish-brown
colour; and beneath this is a much
finer fur or thick down, which is very
useful in the manufacture of hats.
The tail is flattened and covered with
scales.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>THE MOUSE.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c012'>This little creature we all know,
because it eats our cheese, and tries
all the good things in the larder, we
keep a cat to catch it: yet it is very
pretty. It hides itself in the walls and
under the floors; and in these places
it sometimes lays up a considerable
store of provision for future subsistence.
Its food is various; and, as it
is able to pass through a very small
hole, there are few places secure
from its approach. It seems a constant
attendant on man, and is to be
found only near his dwelling. Its
sight and hearing are extremely
acute: and as soon as it observes
the least motion, or hears the
slightest noise, it listens attentively,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>sitting erect on its hinder feet; and,
if the alarm continues, it runs in
haste to its retreat. But if it be
gradually encouraged, and nourishment
and security are offered, it will,
by degrees, lose those fears. An instance
is related of a Mouse that
made its appearance every day at
the table of its benefactor, and there
waited until it had received its
usual portion of food, which it devoured,
and then ran away. Some
few of this species are of a pure white
colour; but whether they be a permanent
kind, or only an accidental
variety, cannot well be determined.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>THE MOLE.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c012'>This animal is mostly found in
grounds where the soil is loose and
soft, and affords the greatest quantity
of worms and insects, on which it
feeds. Destined to seek its food under
the surface of the earth, it is wonderfully
adapted by the all-wise Author
of Nature, to its peculiar mode of
living. It enjoys the sense of hearing
and smelling in a very eminent degree:
but is almost void of sight.
To an animal of such habits, a larger
degree of sight would be attended
with great inconvenience, as well
as be liable to continual injuries. Its
eyes are extremely small, and completely
hid in the fur. The form of
this creature’s body, and particularly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>the construction of its fore feet, are
admirably adapted to the purpose of
making its way in the earth, which it
does with wonderful ease: these feet
are quite naked, very broad, with
large palms, almost like a hand:
there are five toes on each, with
strong nails at the end. The hind
feet are very small, with five slender
toes and a small thumb on the inside.
Whenever surprised on the surface
of the ground, the mole disappears in
an instant.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>THE HEDGEHOG.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c012'>The Hedgehog generally resides
in small thickets and hedges; lives
on fruits, worms, beetles, and all
kinds of insects; it conceals itself in
the day, and feeds only during the
night. This animal is provided by
nature with a prickly armour, which
defends it from the attacks of all the
smaller beasts of prey. When alarmed,
it immediately collects itself
into the form of a ball, and presents
on all sides a surface covered with
sharp points, which few animals are
hardy enough to engage. The more
it is harassed, the closer it rolls itself.
There are few dogs that will venture
to attack the Hedgehog. This little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>animal has been so far domesticated
as to learn to turn a spit by means
of a small wheel in which it is placed;
it likewise answered to its name. In
the winter, it wraps itself up in a
warm nest, made of moss, dried
grass, and leaves; and sleeps out
the greater part of that season. It is
frequently found so completely encircled
with herbage that it resembles
a ball of dried leaves.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>THE BAT.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>This curious animal appears at first
sight to be a bird, but it has nothing
in common with them, but the power
of raising itself into the air. The
common species of this animal is
about the size of a mouse, or nearly
two inches and a half in length: the
wings are in fact an extension of the
skin all round the body; it is stretched
on every side when the animal flies,
by the four inner toes of the fore feet,
which are very long.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>THE BAT.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c013'>The body of the Bat is covered
with a short fur, of a mouse colour,
tinged with red; the eyes are very
small, and the ears like those of a
mouse.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>The Bat appears early in the summer,
and begins its flight towards
evening. It feeds upon gnats, moths,
and almost all insects. This animal
sleeps away the greater part of its
time, never venturing abroad by
day-light, nor yet in wet weather.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>THE GUINEA PIG.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c012'>This curious little animal, which is
sometimes called the Restless Cavy,
is a native of Brazil, but many of
them are kept in a domestic state in
various countries. It is of the rabbit
kind, and resembles that animal
very much in its appearance and
habits. It is not quite so large as
the rabbit, and is marked with white,
black, and orange colours. It has
not got any tail, which makes it look
very curious. It is a very neat animal,
and spends much of its time in
cleaning the fur of its companions.
It never seems to form any attachment,
and will suffer its young to be
taken away and destroyed, without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>making any resistance. If any of
their young ones chance to get dirtied
the female takes such a dislike to
them, that she will never let them
come near her again.</p>
<p class='c014'>Guinea Pigs will sometimes scratch
and kick each other till they are
covered with blood.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>THE OTTER.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c012'>These animals are, in general, rather
more than three feet long from
the point of their nose to the tip of
their tail. Their legs are very short,
but they are strong and muscular.
The colour of their body is mostly of
a deep brown.</p>
<p class='c014'>Otters live chiefly on the banks of
rivers or brooks. They make the
entrance to their burrows under
water, and work upwards, forming
several lodges, that they may have
a retreat in case of high floods; they
end by making a small hole for the
purpose of admitting air, but they
take care that this hole shall come
out in the midst of some thick bush,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>so that they may not be discovered.
They are easily tamed, and are kept
by many fishermen, being found of
great service. The fishermen send
them into the water, and they will
often drive the fish into their nets,
and sometimes bring out the larger
ones in their mouths.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>THE ICHNEUMON.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>This curious little animal is a native
of Egypt, Barbary, and the Cape of
Good Hope. It is, in general, about
the size of a common cat, but rather
longer in its body, and shorter in its
legs. Its colour is a pale reddish
grey. It is sometimes streaked with
a variety of colours, in the same
manner as a domestic cat. While
eating, it sits upright, and uses its
fore feet like hands.</p>
<div  class='figcenter id002'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>THE ICHNEUMON.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c013'>This animal is the boldest and most
useful of the weasel kind. It is of
very great service in Egypt, and indeed
is almost worshipped there, for
it destroys a great quantity of the
eggs of the crocodile, and will even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>attack the crocodile itself. Rats,
mice, birds, serpents, and lizards
become its prey; and it will even
seize the most poisonous reptiles, and
if bitten by them, it is said to be able
to cure itself by the use of some herb.
The Egyptians esteem it so much,
that they keep it in their houses, as
we do the cat.</p>
